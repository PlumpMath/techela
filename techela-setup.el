;;; techela-setup.el --- setup techela courses and admin config file

;; The setup for techela is a ~/.techela file that contains some
;; configuration data for user and admin courses, and a directory
;; ~/techela that is a directory containing the courses. We modify the
;; ssh command in techela_ssh so that it uses a config file
;; ~/.ssh/techela_config which points to a specific id_rsa
;; (~/.ssh/techela_id) key we are going to use.
;;
;; we use the same setup for users and admins (instructors).
